# Analysis-of-annual-sales-of-product
A marketing researcher studied annual sales of a product that had been introduced 10 years
ago. The data are as follows, where x is the year coded and y is the sales in thousands of units:<br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>x</th>
    <th>y</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>98</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>135</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>162</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>178</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>221</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>232</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>283</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>300</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>374</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>395</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Objectives:

a) Prepare a scatter plot of the data<br>
b) State the estimated regression line for the data and add it to the scatter plot.<br>
c) Use the model to predict the sales in the 10th year (i.e. For x=10). Also provide the 95% and
90% confidence interval for the predicted value.<br>
